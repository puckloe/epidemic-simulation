# epidemic-simulation
A program that simulates an epidemic giving parameters for the infecltion.

I made this program for a competition in Year 11 and thought it was quite good.

I wanted to be able to have a program where you input information about the virus and then it would simulate how it would spread.

This would be useful to compare different diseases and how they compare to each other.
